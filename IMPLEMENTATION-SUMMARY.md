- Alert created ONLY after email verification

### 2. Enhanced Security
- Cryptographic verification tokens (32 bytes)
- One-time use tokens
- Tokens cleared after verification
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Secure JSONB storage for pending data

### 3. Email Verification System
- Professional HTML verification emails
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Alert details shown in email
- Beautiful success pages
- Mobile-responsive design

### 4. Alert Protection
- Alerts ONLY created for verified users
- Weekly emails ONLY sent to verified users
- Unverified users receive NOTHING

                                ‚Üì
                    User Created (NOT VERIFIED)
                    Pending Alert Data Stored
                    NO Alert Created Yet

                                ‚Üì
                Alert Created from Pending Data
                Pending Data Cleared

                                ‚Üì
            Weekly Emails Start (Verified Users Only)
```

## Database Schema Changes

### New Field: `pendingAlertData`
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Users"
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "pendingAlertData" JSONB DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Stores:
```json
{
  "alertName": "User's Alert Name",
  "keywords": "AI, blockchain, CBDC",
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints Created

**1. POST /api/auth/register-with-alert**
- Registers user with alert data
- Sends verification email
- Returns success message

**2. GET /api/auth/verify-email/:token**
- Verifies email address
- Creates alert from pending data
- Sends welcome email
- Shows success page

## Security Improvements

1. ‚úÖ No alerts created for unverified emails
2. ‚úÖ Cryptographic token generation
3. ‚úÖ One-time use verification tokens
4. ‚úÖ Tokens automatically cleared after use
5. ‚úÖ Weekly emails filtered by verification status
